# AMP Email Webhook System - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

An AMP email webhook system that receives, processes, and stores form submission data from AMP-enabled emails. The system provides a secure endpoint for handling dynamic email interactions and enables real-time data collection from email recipients.

The webhook serves as a bridge between AMP email forms and backend systems, allowing businesses to capture user responses directly from emails without requiring users to visit external websites.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 User Roles

| Role                 | Registration Method      | Core Permissions                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Email Recipient      | No registration required | Can submit forms via AMP emails                                    |
| System Administrator | Direct system access     | Can configure webhooks, view submissions, manage security settings |
| API Consumer         | API key authentication   | Can retrieve submission data via REST API                          |

### 2.2 Feature Module

Our AMP webhook system consists of the following main components:

1. **Webhook Endpoint**: receives AMP form submissions, validates requests, processes data.
2. **Data Storage**: stores submission data, manages data retention, provides query capabilities.
3. **Admin Dashboard**: displays submission analytics, manages webhook configuration, monitors system health.
4. **API Interface**: provides REST endpoints for data retrieval, supports webhook management operations.

## 3. Core Process

**AMP Email Submission Flow:**

1. User receives AMP-enabled email with interactive form
2. User fills out form fields within the email client
3. User submits form, triggering POST request to webhook endpoint
4. Webhook validates AMP signature and request authenticity
5. System processes and stores submission data
6. Webhook returns appropriate response to email client
7. User sees confirmation message within email

**Admin Management Flow:**

1. Administrator accesses dashboard via secure login
2. Admin configures webhook settings and security parameters
3. Admin monitors submission data and system performance
4. Admin exports data or integrates with external systems via API
